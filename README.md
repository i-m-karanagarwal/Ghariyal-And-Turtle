# UAV and Deep Learning: Detection of selected riparian species along the Ganga River

 Environmental protection and sustainable natural resource management are being recognised worldwide as essential goals to safe guard human health and wellbeing. Riparian zones, that face the highest decline in freshwater biodiversity, are of prime conservation priority because they are essential for regulating climate, preserving aquatic-terrestrial biodiversity, maintaining ground water recharge and restoring rivers. In today's fast-paced data-driven environment, artificial intelligence (AI) is the precise answer to a wide range of problems including biodiversity conservation and wildlife management. Leveraging advancements like Uncrewed/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and AI has resulted innovative strides in wildlife conservation. This study utilised UAV imagery to record high-resolution data of aquatic habitat and species along the Ganga River and employed deep learning algorithms to analyse the data. Through extensive field surveys in the Hastinapur Wildlife Sanctuary, 7,025 photos representing a variety of environments, including 20,000 annotated samples of aquatic animals such as turtles and gharials were generated.
